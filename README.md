# Security Analysis: User Deletion After Authentication

## Introduction

In our web application, we implemented a feature allowing user account deletion after authentication. This section analyzes the security implications of this design choice and explores the crucial distinctions between authentication and authorization in web security.

## Analysis of the Requirement

The requirement states: "This delete user functionality can be done after authentication."

### Is this a good idea?

While allowing user deletion after authentication provides a straightforward user experience, it presents significant security risks if not implemented with additional authorization checks.

#### Pros:
1. Simplifies user flow for account management
2. Ensures only logged-in users can initiate deletion requests

#### Cons:
1. Increases the risk of unauthorized account deletions
2. May not sufficiently protect against attacks using stolen credentials

### Security Implications

Implementing deletion solely based on authentication can lead to several vulnerabilities:

1. **Credential Theft**: If an attacker gains access to a user's credentials, they could not only access the account but also delete it, causing data loss and user distress.

2. **Session Hijacking**: In cases where session tokens are compromised, an attacker could perform deletions without knowing the actual login credentials.

3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Without proper protections, a malicious site could trick authenticated users into unknowingly deleting their accounts.

4. **Lack of Granular Control**: Administrators or power users might need the ability to delete other accounts, which authentication alone doesn't address.

## Authentication vs. Authorization

To understand why the given requirement is insufficient, it's crucial to differentiate between authentication and authorization.

### Authentication

**Definition**: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity.

**Key Points**:
- Answers the question: "Who are you?"
- Typically involves credentials like usernames and passwords
- Establishes the identity of the user but not what they're allowed to do

### Authorization

**Definition**: Authorization is the process of determining what actions an authenticated entity is permitted to perform.

**Key Points**:
- Answers the question: "What are you allowed to do?"
- Occurs after authentication
- Defines and enforces access rights and permissions

### Why the Distinction Matters

In the context of user deletion:

1. **Authentication** ensures that the request comes from a valid user.
2. **Authorization** determines if that user has the right to perform the deletion action.

By only requiring authentication, we're verifying the user's identity but not their right to perform the deletion. This is particularly problematic for admin functions or in cases where enhanced security is needed for critical actions.

## Recommended Approach

To improve security while maintaining functionality, consider the following:

1. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define user roles (e.g., regular user, admin) and assign deletion permissions accordingly.

2. **Add Additional Verification**: For critical actions like account deletion, implement additional checks such as:
   - Re-entering the password
   - Sending a confirmation email with a time-limited token
   - Using two-factor authentication for the deletion process

3. **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging for all deletion attempts, successful or not, to track potential misuse or attacks.

4. **Session Management**: Ensure robust session handling to prevent unauthorized actions through session-based attacks.

## Conclusion

While allowing user deletion after authentication provides a base level of security, it falls short of best practices in web application security. By understanding and implementing both authentication and authorization, we can create a more secure and robust user management system. This not only protects our users' data but also provides a foundation for more complex access control as the application grows.
